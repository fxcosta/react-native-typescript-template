## Useful Tips & Notes

### Apple Store Connect's missing compliance
This is added to your `Info.plist` in order to avoid Apple Store Connect's missing compliance warning.

```plist
<key>ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption</key>
<false/>
```
So you don't have to *Provide Export Compliance Information* at **every push**,


<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i7ret.png" height="100">

> Note that you might have to set that to `<true/>` if your [app uses encryption](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/itsappusesnonexemptencryption)


### Responsiveness with react-native-normalize

Use the **normalize** functio from react-native-normalize whenever you have to use a *hard value* (100, 200, 1000,...). This function will adapt your value accordingly to different screen sizes

### Without `normalize`

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bLbnjsC.jpg" height="250"/>

### With `normalize`
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4IqqAR2.jpg" height="250"/>

### Static bundle

The static bundle is built every time you target a physical device, even in Debug. To save time, the bundle generation [is disabled in Debug](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device)


### react-native-screens

You can use react-native-screens with react-navigation in order to [improve memory consumption](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/community-libraries-and-navigators.html#react-native-screens)

- Install and follow steps in `Usage with react-navigation (without Expo)` from [react-native-screens](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-screens)

- Open `./src/index.tsx` and uncomment

```javascript
// import { enableScreens } from 'react-native-screens';
// enableScreens();
```

### React Native Extended Stylesheet

[react-native-extended-stylesheet](https://github.com/vitalets/react-native-extended-stylesheet) is a drop-in replacement of React Native StyleSheet with media-queries, variables, dynamic themes, relative units, percents, math operations, scaling and other styling stuff.


### Patch Package

When developing with React Native, sometimes I found bugs in the packages that I use so I fix them directly in the *node_modules/package-with-bug*. However, when I install a new package with *npm install*, the changes I made got override.

To prevent this, I use  [patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) which allows me to modify and keep the changes I made.

> So no more waiting around for pull requests to be merged and published. No more forking repos just to fix that one tiny thing preventing your app from working.

Example:

```
# fix a bug in one of your dependencies
vim node_modules/some-package/brokenFile.js

# run patch-package to create a .patch file
npx patch-package some-package

# commit the patch file to share the fix with your team
git add patches/some-package+3.14.15.patch
git commit -m "fix brokenFile.js in some-package"
```

### NavigationService

You can [navigate without navigation prop](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/navigating-without-navigation-prop.html) by using **NavigationService** from `src/lib/NavigationService.ts`

```typescript
import NavigationService from '../lib/NavigationService';

//...

NavigationService.navigate('ChatScreen', { userName: 'Lucy' });
```


### Beta distribution with Fastlane
- Install [fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/setup/)
  ```bash
  # Using RubyGems
  sudo gem install fastlane -NV

  # Alternatively using Homebrew
  brew cask install fastlane
  ```

> If you have issue installing or using fastlane on macos, check this solution: https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/15467#issuecomment-543093498

#### iOS
- Open your project Xcode workspace and update your app's `Bundle Identifier` and `Team`
- Initialize fastlane
  ```bash
  cd <PROJECT_NAME>/ios
  fastlane init
  ```
- Distribute your app
  ```bash
  fastlane beta
  ```

#### Android
- [Collect your Google Credentials](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/android/setup/#collect-your-google-credentials)
- Open your project with Android Studio and update your app's `applicationId` in `build.gradle (Module: app)` file
- Select `Generated Signed Bundle / APK...` from the `Build` menu
- `Next` then `Create new...` under `Key store path` then `Next` and `Finish`
- The first time you deploy your application, you MUST upload it into Google Play Console manually. Google don't allow to use theirs APIs for the first upload.
- Create your application in the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/) (unlike for iOS Fastlane cannot do that for you)
- Make sure that these 4 checkmark icons are green
    > Recommended order: `Pricing & distribution`, `Content rating`, `Store listing` and `App releases`

    > You can find the required assets for `Store listing` in the `publishing/android` folder


    <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C7vDL.png" height="250"/>

- Initialize fastlane
  ```bash
  cd <PROJECT_NAME>/android
  fastlane init
  ```
- Use the Fastfile from `publishing`
  ```bash
  cp publishing/android/fastlane/Fastfile android/fastlane
  ```

- Distribute your app
  ```bash
  fastlane beta
  ```

    >  There is no official plugin to automatically upgrade android version code (unlike the iOS lane).
Before each deployment, be sure to manually upgrade the `versionCode` value inside `android/app/build.gradle`.

#### More
- Checkout the [Fastlane's beta distribution guide](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/react-native-boilerplate/blob/master/docs/beta%20builds.md) for more details
- [Fastlane's documentation](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/cross-platform/react-native/) for React Native


### Cocoapod

When you run `react-native link` and the linked library has podspec file, then the linking will use Podfile. To disable this feature, remove

```ruby
# Add new pods below this line
```

from line 24 in `ios/Podfile`
